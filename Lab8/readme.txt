Components of LAB 8

I have visualized the following graphics for Iris data available in UCI repository or default repository of R and also added all the required interactie features.

1. Histograms of all the properties
2. Scatter plot of data points with each species in different color
3. Violin or Box plot for separate species in a single plot
